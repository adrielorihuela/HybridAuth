/**

 * <p>Everything is done with events rather than by patching the login handlers. A single
 * {@link ServerPreConnectEvent} listener covers every route to a backend — the initial connect for
 * both the pre-1.20.2 and 1.20.2+ login paths, {@code /server}, this fork's {@code comandos}
 * shortcuts, forced hosts and plugin-initiated redirects — because they all end up in
 * {@code createConnectionRequest}. That keeps {@code PostLoginEvent} firing normally, which the
 * earlier attempt broke.</p>
 *
 * <p>Chat needs no handling: the authentication server never registers a serverbound chat
 * packet, so anything a waiting player types is discarded there and cannot reach a real server.
 * Denying
 * {@link com.velocitypowered.api.event.player.PlayerChatEvent} would kick 1.19.1+ clients
 * outright.</p>
