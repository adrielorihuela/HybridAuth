/**
 * The authentication server: a limbo world run inside the proxy JVM, bound to loopback, where
 * players wait until they register or log in.
 *
 * <p>{@code auth/settings.yml} is written once from a documented template and then never touched
 * again, so the operator's edits and its comments survive. It carries no bind address and no
 * forwarding: binding anywhere but loopback would expose an unauthenticated world to the network,
 * and a forwarding mode that disagrees with the proxy's breaks the handshake, so those two are
 * passed to {@link LimboServer} in code and never appear on disk at all.</p>
