# HybridVelocity documentation

Everything this fork adds on top of upstream [Velocity](https://docs.papermc.io/velocity). Anything
not covered here behaves exactly as it does upstream, so the Velocity documentation still applies.

## [guide/](guide/) — using the proxy

Start here if you want to run it.

| Document | |
| --- | --- |
| [getting-started.md](guide/getting-started.md) | Install, first run, upgrading from stock Velocity, and what is on by default. |
| [offline-auth.md](guide/offline-auth.md) | The register/login gate: options, what a player sees, and what to back up. |
| [server-commands.md](guide/server-commands.md) | The `comandos` option: a command per server, and its permissions. |
| [hybrid-offline-profiles.md](guide/hybrid-offline-profiles.md) | How players Mojang cannot verify are given an identity. |

## [development/](development/) — how it was built

Why the fork works the way it does: the specification, the protocol research, the failed first
attempt and what it taught us. Read this before changing the authentication code — most of it exists
to stop a specific mistake being repeated.

| Document | |
| --- | --- |
| [offline-auth-specification.md](development/offline-auth-specification.md) | The original functional specification the feature implements. |
| [offline-auth-postmortem.md](development/offline-auth-postmortem.md) | The first attempt, how the client failed, and the six causes. |
| [offline-auth-requirements.md](development/offline-auth-requirements.md) | What the vanilla client demands per version: configuration phase, registries and tags, the PLAY spawn sequence, KeepAlive and timeouts. |
| [offline-auth-plan.md](development/offline-auth-plan.md) | The architecture that was chosen, and the alternatives rejected. |
| [auth-server.md](development/auth-server.md) | The vendored NanoLimbo subtree: layout and local patches. |
| [updating-upstreams.md](development/updating-upstreams.md) | How to pull changes from Velocity and NanoLimbo. |
| [discarded/](development/discarded/) | Superseded analysis, kept for the reasoning it records. |
